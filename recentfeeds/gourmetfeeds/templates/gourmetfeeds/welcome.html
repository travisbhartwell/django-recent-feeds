<p>Recent Feeds is an application to help monitor Delicious.com RSS
feeds.  I often will look at a Delicious page for a given tag (say,
<a href="http://www.delicious.com/tag/emacs/">http://www.delicious.com/tag/emacs/</a>)
to see what people are bookmarking.  Delicious provides a corresponding RSS feed, but there
are so many repeats (as the feed contains an entry for every time
someone bookmarks a given URL), that the useful information is lost in
the noise.  Delicious already tracks a URL with uniqueness, so the
information is there to do the appropriate filtering.</p>

<p>
Recent Feeds is the solution to this.  Each user that registers on the
site can subscribe to any feed from Delicious.com and it will track
each bookmarked URL seen across that user's subscribed feeds.  A
corresponding RSS URL on Recent Feeds will be given for the user to
subscribe to in their feed reader.  That feed will only contain
entries for bookmarks the user has not yet seen before across any of
their subscribed feeds.
